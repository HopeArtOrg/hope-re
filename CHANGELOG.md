## [2.1.7] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- Fix ONNX model inference running on CPU-only even when GPU acceleration is available because `load_model()` in `model.rs` never called `build_execution_providers()`, while the separate `create_ort_session` test command did; protection pipeline now uses CUDA (NVIDIA), DirectML (Windows), CoreML (macOS/iOS), or XNNPACK (Linux/Android) when available
- Fix `theme.svelte.ts` not following the `use-*.svelte.ts` store naming convention; rename to `use-theme.svelte.ts` and update imports in `+layout.svelte` and `theme-toggle.svelte`

### Changed

- Increase noise algorithm epsilon from `intensity * 0.16` to `intensity * 0.48` and iterations from 250 to 500 for significantly stronger adversarial perturbation
- Increase noise `alpha_multiplier` from 3.0 to 5.0 and reduce `perceptual_weight` from 0.4 to 0.15 to allow more aggressive per-step changes
- Increase glaze algorithm epsilon from `intensity * 0.10` to `intensity * 0.36` and iterations from 350 to 600 for stronger style cloaking
- Increase glaze `alpha_multiplier` from 2.5 to 4.5 and reduce `perceptual_weight` from 0.8 to 0.3
- Increase nightshade algorithm epsilon from `intensity * 0.09` to `intensity * 0.32` and iterations from 500 to 750 for stronger data poisoning
- Increase nightshade `alpha_multiplier` from 3.0 to 5.0 and reduce `perceptual_weight` from 1.2 to 0.4
- Increase `SPSA_DIRECTIONS_PER_ITER` from 8 to 12 for higher-quality gradient estimates producing stronger perturbations
- Raise edge weight map floor from 0.3 to 0.5 so flat/smooth image areas receive more perturbation instead of concentrating only on edges
- Widen intensity slider range from 1-25 (max 0.25) to 1-50 (max 0.50) and update default from 50 to 30
- Update intensity level thresholds from Low (<0.09) / Medium (<0.17) / High to Low (<0.15) / Medium (<0.35) / High
- Update render quality time estimates to reflect increased iteration counts: Faster ~2-5 mins, Fast ~10-25 mins, Default ~20-50 mins, Slower ~40-90 mins, Slowest ~60-150 mins
- Fix README incorrectly describing TanStack Query as managing "server state" when the app is fully static and client-side with no backend server; all query operations invoke local Tauri commands via IPC
- Add tribute to the original Hope app (version 1) in README with links to `HopeADeff/Hope` and `HopeArtOrg/hope-archive`

## [2.1.6] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- Fix macOS DMG builds failing Gatekeeper privacy checks by adding ad-hoc code signing (`signingIdentity: "-"`) to `bundle.macOS` in Tauri config, allowing the app to pass macOS security validation without a paid Apple Developer certificate
- Fix spurious `nul` file created in the project root on Windows when Tauri redirects output to the `NUL` device during builds; delete the file and add `nul` to `.gitignore`

### Changed

- Bump `@tanstack/svelte-query` from 6.0.18 to 6.1.0

- Bump `svelte` from 5.53.5 to 5.53.6
- Bump `svelte-check` from 4.4.3 to 4.4.4

## [2.1.5] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- Fix minimized dock never rendering in the DOM because `useModelDownload()` declared all `$state` variables (`isDownloading`, `modelProgress`, `minimized`, etc.) inside the function body, making each caller get completely independent state; when `ResourceDownloadGuard` set `minimized = true`, the `MinimizedDock` instance still had `minimized = false`
- Move model download shared state (`isDownloading`, `currentModelIndex`, `modelProgress`, `error`, `minimized`) to module scope so all consumers share the same singleton state, matching the pattern already used by `useUpdater()`
- Fix updater `dismiss()` not closing the dialog when a download/install is active, leaving both the dialog overlay and the minimized dock competing for attention

## [2.1.4] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- Fix minimized dock pill buttons invisible against page background due to `bg-background/95` blending into the page and `border-border/40` having near-zero effective opacity in dark mode
- Replace near-transparent dock styling with opaque `bg-card` background, full `border-border`, and `ring-1 ring-border/50` outer ring for clear visibility in both light and dark themes
- Increase icon container background from `bg-primary/10` to `bg-primary/15` for stronger icon presence

### Changed

- Replace `Minimize2Icon` (diagonal shrink arrow) with `MinusIcon` (standard window minimize dash) in model download and updater dialogs for a more recognizable minimize affordance

## [2.1.3] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- Fix window drag, maximize, and close buttons blocked by dialog overlays on Windows because the `fixed inset-0 z-50` overlay covered the custom titlebar drag region
- Fix model download dialog being completely unclosable and blocking the entire app with no way to interact with the titlebar while downloading
- Fix minimized dock positioned at bottom-left where it was not discoverable, move to bottom-right
- Fix minimize button placed on left side of dialogs inconsistent with close button position, move to top-right
- Fix invalid `inset-s-4` class on updater dialog minimize button
- Replace deprecated Tailwind v3 classes with v4 idioms: `outline-none` to `outline-hidden`, arbitrary centering values to fraction utilities, `ring-offset` pattern to `focus-visible:ring` pattern

### Features

- Add retractable dialog system for model downloader and updater dialogs with minimize button that collapses active background tasks into floating dock icons at bottom-right
- Add minimized dock component showing real-time download/update progress with animated activity indicators and click-to-restore behavior
- Add minimize-on-escape support for model download dialog when download is in progress

### Changed

- Set `data-platform="windows"` on document root to enable platform-specific CSS for dialog overlay offset below the 30px custom titlebar
- Update updater dialog dismiss behavior to auto-minimize instead of closing when download or install is active
- Update updater dialog to hide close button and show minimize button during active download/install
- Update model download store with `minimized`, `needsDialog`, `dialogOpen`, `minimize()`, and `restore()` for retractable dialog support
- Update updater store with `minimized`, `isActive`, `minimize()`, and `restore()` for retractable dialog support
- Replace `MinimizeIcon` with `Minimize2Icon` for clearer minimize affordance in both dialogs
- Remove redundant minimize button from updater dialog footer, consolidate to top-right icon only

## [2.1.1] - 2026-03-01

- Fix release notes rendered as plain text instead of parsed markdown, losing all formatting from GitHub release bodies

### Performance

- Eliminate per-direction `Array4` heap allocations in SPSA hot loop by pre-allocating plus/minus tile buffers and writing directly via `as_slice_mut` + `copy_from_slice`
- Increase `SPSA_DIRECTIONS_PER_ITER` from 4 to 8 for higher-quality gradient estimation producing stronger adversarial perturbations
- Lower SPSA momentum beta from 0.9 to 0.85 for faster adaptation in short iteration runs
- Reduce perceptual weight for noise (0.5 to 0.4) and nightshade (1.5 to 1.2) to allow stronger perturbation magnitude relative to perceptual constraint

### Changed

- Add `marked` runtime markdown parser for rendering GitHub release notes as formatted HTML in the updater dialog
- Add scrollable release notes area with `max-h-[85vh]` viewport constraint and `overflow-y-auto` so dialog content never exceeds screen bounds
- Add scoped CSS for rendered markdown (headings, lists, code blocks, links, blockquotes) consistent with app design tokens
- Increase noise algorithm epsilon from 0.06 to 0.08 and iterations from 200 to 250 for stronger concept confusion
- Increase noise alpha_multiplier from 2.5 to 3.0 for more aggressive per-step perturbation
- Increase glaze algorithm epsilon from 0.035 to 0.05 and iterations from 300 to 350 for more effective style cloaking

- Increase nightshade algorithm epsilon from 0.03 to 0.045 and alpha_multiplier from 2.5 to 3.0 for stronger data poisoning
- Enhance fallback noise with multi-scale frequency-domain patterns (3 octaves + sinusoidal wave) instead of single-scale block noise for better AI confusion
- Reduce fallback noise step decay from 0.5 to 0.3 for sustained perturbation strength across iterations

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- Fix version numbering scheme so auto-updater correctly detects new releases for users on v2.0.77 and earlier (semver: 2.0.77 > 2.0.8, so those users could never update)

### Performance

- Replace `System::new_all()` + `refresh_all()` with targeted `System::new()` + `refresh_cpu_all()` in CPU info gathering, avoiding unnecessary disk/memory/network enumeration
- Replace `System::new_all()` + `refresh_all()` with targeted `System::new()` + `refresh_memory()` in memory info gathering for the same reason
- Enable ONNX Runtime `GraphOptimizationLevel::Level3` for maximum model graph optimization during session creation
- Reduce perceptual loss computation from two separate accumulator loops to a single `(diff_plus^2 - diff_minus^2)` difference accumulator, halving per-element work
- Replace division-by-3 in edge weight grayscale conversion with multiplication by `1.0 / 3.0` for faster FP math
- Use iterator-based `fold` for min/max edge weight computation instead of manual branching loop
- Pre-compute row offsets in edge weight Sobel filter to eliminate repeated `y * w` multiplications

- Restore SPSA decay exponents to standard values (gamma=0.101, alpha=0.602) matching optimization literature
- Restore SPSA momentum beta to 0.9 and perturbation probe size (`ck_initial`) to `epsilon * 0.1` for stable convergence

## [2.0.77] - 2026-02-28

### Performance

- Pre-allocate SPSA buffers (`direction`, `plus_data`, `minus_data`, `grad_estimate`) once outside the iteration loop instead of allocating 150,528-element vectors every iteration
- Add momentum (beta=0.9) to SPSA gradient descent for faster convergence with fewer iterations, replacing raw sign-based PGD
- Eliminate f32-to-u8-to-f32 roundtrip in tile blending by reading protected tile values directly from the Array4 instead of converting through `tile_to_pixels` intermediate buffer
- Skip bilinear interpolation in tile blending when tile dimensions match TILE_SIZE (224x224), avoiding unnecessary per-pixel math for full-size tiles
- Simplify SPSA edge weight expansion from triple-expand `[ew, ew, ew]` + flatten pattern to direct per-channel assignment, eliminating intermediate `Vec<[f32; 3]>` allocation
- Extract shared `create_image_tensor()` helper in algorithms module to deduplicate tensor creation across noise, glaze, and nightshade model runners
- Pre-allocate base64 encoding output buffer with estimated capacity based on pixel count and quality setting
- Increase `alpha_multiplier` from 2.5 to 3.5 (noise, nightshade) and 2.0 to 3.0 (glaze) for stronger per-iteration perturbation impact
- Simplify SPSA gradient computation from `diff / (2.0 * ck * direction[i])` to `diff_over_2ck * direction[i]` by factoring out the constant divisor

### Features

- Add manual update check button to header alongside system info and theme toggle
- Show toast notification when manually checking for updates and already on latest version

### Changed

- Redesign update dialog to match Zen aesthetic with `CircleArrowUpIcon`, version subtitle, "What's new" label, monospace progress percentage, and cleaner button labels

- Group tile blend parameters into `TileRegion` struct to satisfy clippy `too_many_arguments` lint

## [2.0.76] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- Fix `STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION` crash during ONNX model inference caused by DirectML execution provider failing to handle jax2onnx-exported ops, segfaulting on partial node assignment
- Fix ONNX input name mismatch where jax2onnx auto-generated names (`in_0`, `in_1`) did not match hardcoded names (`input`, `style_index`, `target_index`) by switching to positional `ort::inputs!` macro arguments
- Fix `TensorRef` (borrowed) and `Tensor` (owned) mixed ownership in `ort::inputs!` macro causing undefined memory access with GPU execution providers
- Fix ndarray version mismatch between project (`ndarray 0.16`) and `ort` crate (`ndarray 0.17`) by constructing tensors via `(shape, Box<[T]>)` tuple form instead of passing `Array4` directly
- Fix nightshade algorithm stuck at 0% progress due to CPU inference being ~100x slower than GPU, making SPSA loop take 10-40 minutes per tile before any progress event emitted

### Changed

- Load ONNX models with CPU-only execution provider instead of DirectML/CUDA to prevent segfaults from unsupported GPU ops
- Reduce `SPSA_DIRECTIONS_PER_ITER` from 16 to 4 for feasible CPU inference times while maintaining gradient estimation quality
- Reduce noise `max_iterations` from 250 to 50, glaze from 350 to 60, nightshade from 500 to 75 to target ~1-2 minutes per tile on CPU
- Remove unused `array4_to_tensor_ref` function and `TensorRef` import from preprocessing module

## [2.0.75] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- Refactored `spsa_pgd_on_tile` function to reduce parameters from 9 to 7 by grouping progress-related parameters into a new `TileProgress` struct

- Fix gradient averaging dividing by total directions instead of only successful directions, under-weighting gradients when some ONNX inferences fail
- Fix GELU activation mismatch in ONNX export notebook using `jax.nn.gelu(x, approximate=True)` instead of `nn.gelu(x)` matching training notebooks
- Fix ONNX models not bundled in desktop production builds because `resources` array in `tauri.conf.json` was empty, causing silent fallback to basic random noise instead of CLIP-guided adversarial perturbation
- Fix SPSA optimization producing weak perturbations due to low default intensity (20/100, epsilon=0.024) being 40% of training baseline (epsilon=0.06); raise default to 50/100 to match training
- Fix SPSA optimization under-converging due to low default render quality (50%) halving iteration count; raise default to 75%

### Bug Fixes

- Fix CUDA inference incorrectly reported as available on systems without NVIDIA GPU by adding `has_nvidia_gpu()` hardware check before `CUDA::default().is_available()`

- Add `model_used` field to `ProtectionResult` so frontend can distinguish real ONNX model protection from fallback noise
- Show warning toast "Image protected with basic fallback. Download AI models for stronger protection." when fallback is used instead of misleading success message
- Add `onnx_stubs` module with stub Tauri commands for unsupported Android architectures (x86, x86_64) to allow compilation without ONNX Runtime
